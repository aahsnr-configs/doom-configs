In my current proposed workflow, I want to do python programming in jupyter notebooks but instead of using jupyter notebooks, I intend to use org-mode with the emacs-jupyter package to mimic the features of jupyter notebooks in general.
I indent to preserve the context between the source code blocks, especially for jupyter-python source code blocks. In other words, lets

The link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minad/corfu/refs/heads/main/extensions/corfu-popupinfo.el is a current file for the corfu-popupinfo extension in corfu. My attached doom emacs configuration is giving the error in the attached screenshot. Search the web, and the link to find a solution.

For the attached doom emacs configuration files, is the solution in LSP IN ORG SOURCE BLOCKS inspired by https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gav451/oglot/refs/heads/main/oglot.el enough for an efficient literate python programming using emacs-jupyter and org-mode? Or do I need to use the oglot package direclty? Keep in mind that this package an year old and has not be been updated for that time period. Make any necessary changes as you see fit. But make sure to only use emacs and doom-emacs best practices and also make sure to use up-to-date information and changes.

- [ ] For the attached doom emacs configuration files, the section titled LSP in Org Source Blocks is meant to help org source code blocks retain context from the whole tangled python source code block, so that diagnostics, completions and other lsp features that are typically available for a specific python file is also available to buffers opened by org-edit-special or org-edit-src-code. LSP servers need access to a file that it's running on that it provides all the lsp server capabilities to this file. Org src buffers typically are not associated with files, but that section tried to fill the gap by drawing context from a tangled file that contained all the contents from the tangled source code files. Each of the source code block typically associated with the same file to achieve this. This was done for eglot.

The attached lsp-bridge-org-babel.el is a version of how to achieve the above intended functionalities. Thoroughly research the web and make sure the implementation is correct and free of issues. Then guide me how to implement this to my doom emacs configuration config.org file.

Your first start is to read my doom emacs configuration files in the code blocks of the attached markdown file. Then your next task is to carefully analyze and understand my config files. Then you must carefully read through all the needed files in the entire github source tree of the Doom Emacs project in https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs as of May 2026 for the necessary parts of my doom emacs config files. Then determine if there are any redundant configuration settings in the config.org file and any redundant packages declared in the packages.el that are configured and shipped by default by the doom emacs project. You have to do this analyze by understand that what default settings and packages are shipped are determined by the configuration of the init.el present in the attached markdown file. You must not guess anything. You must actually read the files to confirm anything. The ligatures module from doom emacs might be deprecated in favor of ligature.el. Read READM.org file in the markdown file. Then only write out the changes needed in git diff syntax in the markdown output. You must perform or simulate an agentic workflow for this very task. And the information you get must be the latest.

Write a more comprehensive and organized version of the following prompt, but do not execute any tasks from this updated prompt:

The root directory of the agentic workflow files will have the following additional folders to work with: (1) emacs folder containing my vanilla emacs configuration with the config.org file containing my whole emacs configuration, early-init.el file and the lisp/org-src-context.el file (2) doomemacs folder with github source tree file from the doom emacs project in https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs. What would be the best way to setup an multi-phase agentic workflow setup for the following prompt using pydantic, langgraph and litellm. The final doom emacs config.org file that will be created from the following prompt must be regularly updated on a monthly basis by keeping track of the doomemacs github project in the doom emacs folder of the root directory. For the multi-phase agentic workflow there must at least 4-5 phases, with at least one phase dedicated to ingesting my emacs configuration files from the emacs folders, at least one phase dedicated to ingesting the necessary modules files, related to what had been learned from ingesting my emacs config files, in the modules subfolder of the doomemacs folder, and then another phase later phase dedicated to making sure there are no redudant package declarations and redundant configuration settings for the translated doom emacs configuration in the doom emacs config.org. The agentic workflow does not have to create an init.el file within the translated doom emacs config.org file because I will provide an init.el for the translated doom emacs. There must be a smaller phase between ingesting the emacs folder conter and the modules subfolder content to ingest the content of the this init.el. Of course, there must be other phases as well typical of an multi-phase agentic workflow. The python package and the python libraries will be managed by uv assuming that the arch linux the workflow is working will have uv tool installed system-wide. There must be also a bash script to run the workflow and workflow will be run in the terminal.

I want you to translate my whole config.org emacs configuration file from vanilla emacs to doom emacs. I need to write the whole doom emacs configurations files in a single config.org that will tangle and create the necessary doom emacs config files: config.el, init.el and packages.el . Search the web and think longer for all the tasks. I have the following requirements:

- all the configuration files must be handled by a single config.org file
- the doom emacs config is a literate configuration, so init.el file must account for that
- you must be good at writing elisp code and vanilla emacs configuration code conventions
- you must be aware of doom emacs specific syntax and config style (different from vanilla emacs). Youi will use these doom emeacs specific syntax and config style to translate my vanilla emacs configuration to doom emacs
- No hallucinations and guessing are allowed
- the transient configuration from the vanilla emacs config must be retained
- you must verify and audit before writing anything.
- after reading the necessary files from the doom emacs github repository, you must be able to overwrite the default configuration options and code shipped with default emacs if the translation from vanilla emacs to doom emacs demands it. For that it must correctly read the latest version of the necessary files before doing overwriting the specific doom emacs configuration shipped by default
- this is not a one-to-one translation but it must be close enough.
- I also need my org-src-context.el file to be usable in this doom emacs configuration.
- doom emacs config files are located at $HOME/.config/doom

Determine if you need to borrow any workflow logic from the attached markdown file and then rewrite the above prompt again in its entirety. The prompt in this file is for an entirely different task but you should analyze the markdown file to determine if any workflow and design aspects can implemented from it to the above prompt. Also keep in both my doom emacs config files and vanilla emacs config files contain both config.org and init.el files. Your above prompt does not properly mentioned that. That will be confused by any LLM model. The provided doom emacs init.el will be included in the final doom emacs config.org. To be clear, this doom emacs config org file will contain init.el and packages.el content so that the single config.org manages all aspects of the doom emacs configuration and creates the config.el, my provided init.el and the packages.el when doom install and doom sync is executed. Any necessary changes to packages.el and init.el will be made inside the source code blocks for packages.el and init.el in config.org so that doom sync automatically updates the packages.el and init.el files. Also Phase 4 must be done twice. Phase 6 must be done for auditing the whole doom emacs config.org file as well. Phase 6 should not be limited to just Elisp syntax check and structural audit like you mentioned. Then also determine if there needs to be more phases and add theme accordingly. There should be a separate bash script created by the agentic workflow to setup doom emacs for the first time. The script should include the commands in the following markdown code block

```sh
echo "(doom! :config literate)" > ~/.config/doom/init.el
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs
~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install
~/.config/emacs/bin/doom sync
```

Keep in mind that the root directory of the agentic workflow will itself be `~/.config/doom`, so along with the doomemacs subfolder that is obtained using `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs `. This is separate from the similar command in the above markdown code block because doom emacs to work it needs to actually exist in `~/.config/emacs`, but the Maintenance and Continous Update Requirements section from the above prompt still needs to have to happen on a monthly basis. Also determine if I will need any additional phases. Your above prompt was not also specific on how to utilize my emacs lisp/org-src-context.el file. The agentic workflow will need to generate an appropriate README.md file.

The whole `~/.config/doom` folder will managed and tracked by github using a doom-config named repository and contains the all the files, folders and submodules from above after the github workflow is finished. And I `git clone` this github project, using `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:aahsnr-configs/doom-config.git ~/.config/doom`

For now, since I have not run the agentic workflow yet, its root directory, `~/.config/doom` will contain, in total:

1.  the `doomemacs` subfolder
2.  `emacs` subfolder containing my emacs configurations files with `config.org`, `early-init.el` and `lisp/org-src-context.el` files
3.  all the files and folders needed for the agentic workflow
4.  doom emacs configuration's `init.el` that the agentic workflow will need you to use. This is the init.el file that I will provide and it will be exist in the root directory

But after the agentic workflow is complete, the root directory `~/.config/doom`, will contain the following files and folder with some expections:

1. the `emacs` subfolder will be deleted as it will no longer be needed.
2. the `doomemacs` subfolder will be retained
3. all the files and folders needed for the agentic workflow and the `Maintenance & Continuous Update Requirements`
4. existing `lisp/org-src-context.el`
5. created `config.org` file containting the contents of `config.el`, `packages.el` and `init.el` files
6. created README.md
7. .gitignore
8. config.el, init.el and packages.el files will be created by `doom sync` but will not be managed by `doom-config` github project.

Keep in mind that `doomemacs` folder inside `~/.config/doom` root directory is obtained using `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs` so the README.md file the agentic workflow generates must provide instructions on how to setup the doom-config github project locally in my arch linux system. The readme must also provide instructions on how to properly clone the github project as well.

Furthermore, you need to provide more details to the prompt. Also determine if you need to add anything else.

With everything I have told you so far, rewrite the whole prompt from above again from top to bottom in its entirety with all the changes and correction. Do not miss any details. Search the web and think longer for this task.

I don't need workflow visualization. Furthermore, the prompt does not state where the litellm config file and the .env file containing the API keys. They both need to exist inside the root directory. Litellm will be installed and run using podman in a modular approach using the following command:

```sh
podman run -d --name litellm-proxy --restart unless-stopped -p 4000:4000 -v ~/.config/litellm/config.yaml:/app/config.yaml:ro,z $(grep '^goog_' ~/.config/litellm/.env | sed 's/^/-e /') ghcr.io/berriai/litellm:v1.83.14-stable --config /app/config.yaml --port 4000
```

using relative paths only. The agentic workflow must also be run using a separate a bash script that setups python and python libraries in the root project directory. This bash script will also run litellm inside podman using the above podman command.

Also the above prompt contains elements for two different: it contains elements of the prompt needed to run the Agentic Workflow as well as elements of the prompt for setting up an agentic workflow setup. You must two create two different prompts. Then rewrite everything again.

Audit all the python code in the attached markdown and then rewrite the files. Make sure there are no errors, issues and deprecations in the python code and make sure the python code is optimized all the python code for python3.13.13.Use best python 3.13 practices. Search the web and think longer for this task. Then rewrite only the python markdown code blocks. The information you get must be the latest till May 2026.
